# Java Practice Programs – P3 Coursework

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs created as part of company coursework. These exercises focus on core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and algorithm implementation—not DSA (data structures & algorithms).

## 📘 Programs Included

### ✅ OOP & Basic Utilities

- **Employee Management System**  
  Showcases inheritance (e.g., `Employee`, `Manager`) and method overriding.

- **Banking System**  
  Simulates banking operations (deposit, withdrawal, transaction history) using Java collections.

- **Library Management System**  
  Manages book catalog—adding, searching, listing.

- **Student Record Management**  
  Uses encapsulation to store and manage student details and grades.

- **Static & Final Examples**  
  Demonstrates `static` variables/methods and `final` modifiers.

- **Constructor Overloading**  
  Shows multiple constructors for the same class with varied parameters.

### 🔢 Algorithm & Utility Snippets

- **CountGoodDigitString.java** & **GoodDigitStringBruteForce.java**  
  Count digit strings where even indices are even and odd indices are prime (2, 3, 5, 7) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- **reverseString.java**  
  Reverse a string using `StringBuilder` in O(n) time :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **mergeSortedArray.java**  
  Merge two sorted arrays efficiently in O(n + m) time :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **balancedBST.java**  
  Build a height-balanced BST from a sorted array using divide-and-conquer :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

- **matrixMultiplication.java**  
  Classic O(n³) matrix multiplication :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

- **subsets.java**  
  Generate the power set (all subsets) of an array using recursion :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

- **quickSort.java**  
  QuickSort implementation with partition recursion :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

- **linearSearch.java**  
  Linear search with O(n) time complexity :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

- **nestedLoops.java**  
  Example of nested loops—foundation for understanding nested time complexities :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.

## 🛠️ Tools & Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  
- Terminal/command line for compile & run

## 🔄 How to Run

Compiling and running each `.java` file individually:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```
##Example
```bash
javac CountGoodDigitString.java
java CountGoodDigitString
```
## 📌 Key Learnings

- Mastered class and object design
- Applied inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding
- Practiced with `ArrayList`, recursion, and loops
- Explored algorithmic logic at a basic level (e.g., QuickSort, subsets, matrix ops)
- Used constructors, `static`, and `final` keywords effectively
