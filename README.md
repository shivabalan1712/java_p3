# Java Practice Programs – P3 Coursework

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs created as part of Company coursework. These exercises primarily focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## 📘 Overview

The following programs demonstrate core Java concepts in real-world scenarios:

### ✅ Programs Implemented

- **Employee Management System**  
  Showcases inheritance with base and derived classes (`Employee`, `Manager`), and method overriding.
